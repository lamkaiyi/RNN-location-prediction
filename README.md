# Next-Location Prediction using RNN and BiRNN
This project implements and compares Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Bidirectional RNNs (BiRNN) for predicting the next location in a sequence of geospatial or sequential location data.

Prediction results are evaluated using the L2-distance from their ground truth data point.
